You are designing a personal portfolio website for a Computer Science undergraduate named Koushal Pala.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT use or request a personal photo.
- The website must NOT look like an AI-generated template.
- Avoid generic phrases like “passionate developer”, “driven individual”, “tech enthusiast”.
- Write like a real human software engineer, concise and professional.
- Tone should be confident, calm, and recruiter-friendly (HR-safe).
- Design should feel modern, minimal, and aesthetic — not flashy.
- This is a PORTFOLIO, not a resume webpage.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- HR recruiters
- Software engineering hiring managers
- Internship and entry-level software roles

DESIGN STYLE:
- Dark theme by default
- Clean typography (Inter / similar)
- Strong layout hierarchy (hero → projects → experience → contact)
- Use grids and cards, not long paragraphs
- Plenty of whitespace
- Subtle accents (no bright gradients everywhere)
- Smooth, professional UI — feels handcrafted

HERO / FRONT PAGE:
- Clearly show the name: “Koushal Pala”
- Use a SAFE title: “Software Engineer” (do NOT narrow to only backend)
- One short description line:
  “Computer Science undergraduate building scalable software, automation workflows, and real-world applications.”
- Clear CTA buttons: “View Projects” and “GitHub”
- No marketing slogans, no poetic lines

CONTENT TO INCLUDE (USE THESE FACTS):

EDUCATION:
- B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
- SR University
- 2023 – 2027
- CGPA: 8.4
(Keep education minimal and clean, not highlighted like a resume)
